1st of November meeting:
Attendance: Sergio, Andrea Edu.
During this meeting we discussed the topics of the project, the goal of the project is to try to measure the impact of the climate change in the temperature
of two towns in Sweden, the first one we chose was Umea and the second one Flosterbo. The decision is based in the geographical location of both towns
and the amount of data avaiable for both stations, this will be more detailed in the report.

Also in this meeting we decided which graphs we should plot to try to show this shift in the temperature. The detail of the graphs can be found on the report. 
At the end we decided the next step to do in our project, starting for cleaning the data for both stations and settling the ditribution for the GitHub repository.
